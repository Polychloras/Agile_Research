\subsection{Common Factors used in Agile Development of Mobile Apps}

Through our research we have discovered that current software devolpment of both social media and mobile applications
use an Agile approach due to its advantages during a long-term project. Agile development provides an iteterative approach
that doesn't require an exstensive knowledge of all features currently used in the inital design. Agile is commonally described as a flexable software
devolpment process. The success of an software application is defined by [2] how well the application meets the users needs and requirments.
Therefore, most studies measure the Success or Failure of the factors that impact agile development
through quantitative surveys that aim to determine the satisfaction of the users and intention of the application[1][5][9][10][11].
So far the factors that have been researched through quantitative reasearch based on their effect on production quality include Time-To-Market, Uncertentity, 
New-Product-Development-Process (NPD), Cost of Delay, Team Dynamics, Technologies, and Enviromental Factors. [3][9]
